# Pseudopaludicola-matuta
Scripts and morphometric and bioacoustic datasets used for the statistical analyses in the scientific article describing the frog species Pseudopaludicola matuta (https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt/article/view/611). The main objective of this project was to classify individuals of the studied species based on morphometric and acoustic data, using a multivariate approach and machine learning techniques. Additionally, we tested for significant differences with a univariate approach and permutation statistics.

In the datasets I uploaded, the "locality" column includes two categories (=species): "mineira" (P. mineira) and "uai" (P. matuta). The remaining columns contain morphometric and bioacoustic variables.
